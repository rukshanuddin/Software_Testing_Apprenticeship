# Agile Project 1

*This week we're going to be working on a project together in an agile fashion. We're going to treat this like a sprint.*

>Lab-A will focus on creating a spring boot microservice with full CRUD, a database, at least 3 models, and a service layer for each model. All major business logic will have to be tested. Try to be as test-driven as you possibly can. This project will evolve as the week goes on and you will ideally implement a view by the end of the week.

>Lab-C will focus on tackling codewars problems together as a team in an agile fashion. It will be your job to agree on problems together, agree on roles, and assign tasks. You will need to write your tests first and implement the code after the fact in order to follow test-driven-development.

1. Assign your roles! Make sure you have a *team lead* and a *scrum master*. Try to have a *scribe* as well.
2. Create at least one epic with user stories broken down into tasks.
3. Have one repo that everyone will push and pull against up on GitHub. Maintain sensible policies for maintaining branches and avoid pushing to *main* as much as you can.
4. Utilize a system like GitHub Projects or Trello to track issues/tickets. One person will have at least one task at any given time.

## Notes

- It may be wise to have a master document everyone can refer to. This document will exist as a design document of sorts and will outline your agreed upon epic, user stories, and tasks. Maintaining this document will be either the scrum master's job or the dedicated scribe's job.
- You should have a standup everyday. Everyone should appear for the standup with cameras on if possible. The scribe will write down any major takeaways from the standup as a form of documentation.
